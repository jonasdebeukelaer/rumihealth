            <h2>About Ruminant Health</h2>
            <p>Ruminant Health was created by veterinarian Edward De Beukelaer and pharmacist Tony Pinkus as a UK platform to provide training and consultancy for the novel Obsalim technique.</p>
            <p>Edward and Tony decided to set up the company because from their contacts with farmers, they soon realised that introducing Obsalim into modern farming would bring huge benefits to farmer and animals alike and assure increased profitability and animal welfare.</p>
            <p>Obsalim is a unique and powerful observational method designed to empower the ruminant farmer in his decisions about nutrition and other local issues.</p>
            <p>Obsalim is primarily a guide to the status of rumination and provides a simple system of evaluation and correction that farmers can easily be taught in order to understand how their animals respond to their conditions and how these can be modified to maximize productivity and health. Obsalim is designed to be used on a regular basis and provides a dynamic picture of livestock response to both ration and housing. Corrections can then be made and monitored according to a number of real indicators observed the animal.</p>
            <p>Obsalim takes the guesswork out of the feeding and managing of your ruminants, it will bring farmers closer to their animals, it will improve animal welfare and make farms much more economically viable.</p>

                    <p><i>Emily McCoy</i>, 30th March 2017
                    <br>In Wiltshire, England, three farmers have been investigating an unusual, alternative method to manage their organic dairy herds. Emily McCoy reports.</p>
                    <p>Any good farmer will know the value of understanding his or her cows. But what if you take this a step further, what if you evaluate specific cow characteristics and compare them with a picture and a score on a card allowing you to understand how your cows’ digestive system is functioning.</p>

                    <h5>Using Obsalim For Herd Health</h5>
                    <p>A group of Wiltshire dairy farmers have been using a French diagnostic tool to help manage their herds feed and monitor their health. This summer they met to discuss how it had helped them and their animals. 7th November 2016</p>
                    <p><i>How can a pack of cards help manage your herd?</i></p>
                    <p>The Obsalim technique is simply a set of cards which you carry with you in your pocket. Each card relates to a symptom in your animals’ behaviour, or with their eyes, feet, dung or energy levels. Some symptoms would be hard to miss, but others are more subtle. By using the cards, you can diagnose what your herd needs.</p>
                    <p>Christine Gosling from Berkeley Farm Dairy learned about the technique from her vet Edward De Beukelaer and said that “learning to use the cards was like learning a new language. It takes a while to get used to it, but then it starts to come naturally.”  Three farmers took part in the trial, and each had multiple visits from Obsalim trainer Edward De Beukelaer, and the rest of the group. This meant they got to try out the technique with their own cows, which everyone found was the best way to understand the system. </p>

                    <h5>Importance of ruminating cycle underlined by recent Innovative Farmers field lab</h5>
                    <p>15th November 2016</p>
                    <p><b>Innovative Farmers, a not-for-profit network funded by Prince Charles’s Charitable Foundation, highlights the value of herd observation and analysis using the Obsalim® technique, following results from three farms involved in field lab.</b></p>
                    <p>This field lab, held over the past two years, suggested the technique reduces feed costs and improves efficiency by making rumen stability better. Three herds participated in the field lab. An important finding for all herds was the need to establish a synchronised eating and ruminating cycle – helping to prevent overeating.</p>
                    <p>All dairy farmers are constantly observing their herds. But this group of Innovative Farmers used the Obsalim® technique to help analyse the physical condition of their animals. This technique allows the farmer to identify everyday signs (e.g. the condition of the coat or composition of their dung) and using a set of ‘symptom cards’ identify what is happening in the rumen. Following a diagnosis, changes to the distribution or composition of the ration, or to the management of the herd can improve the efficacy of the transformation of the ration, potentially reducing costs and making the herd more productive. </p>

                    <p>6th November 2017</p>
                    <p>Dr Bruno Giboudeau has just completed his Victorian workshops (the last one was at our farm) and he headed back to France yesterday, having brought the Obsalim techniques and learning to over 50 keen participants over the past fortnight. Though most of the workshoppers were dairy farmers, we also had a vet, animal nutritionist and organic milk supply manager attend.</p>
                    <p>Since Obsalim is regional (and farm) specific, the format of the workshops involved using local farms as case studies for the training. Bruno and Lucy Quin – who worked with us to organise and manage the logistics of the workshops and assisted Bruno with the training – visited the case study farms prior, took photos and carried out some Obsalim investigations, providing the host farmers with a report before the workshop proper. During the workshop session, participants were able to learn from the case study farm directly.</p>
                    <p>Lucy has arrived at Holy Goat after a big career change and is particularly interested in the links between animal health and the quality and nutrition of produce and how Obsalim can make those connections.</p>
                    <p>“We had really engaged and interested farmers at every workshop; there were lots of questions, a really positive energy and everyone was really happy to learn and observe and interpret.”</p>

            <p><b>Chris Gosling</b>, Berkeley Dairy Farm, Wroughton:<br>
            "After spending some time learning to observe the cows in a new way and putting the Obsalim technique into practice I was amazed at the improvement in our herd's health."</p>

            <p><b>Jonny Rider</b>, Horton House farm, Devises<br>
            "Three years ago, in the Spring of 2015, we used Obsalim on our milking herd, a month off calving when they were dry.  As result of symptoms shown on the cards, we made changes to our wintering that have reduced the amount of food we use, as well as significantly improving the health & condition of the cows.  We have subsequently used Obsalim during the grazing season & as a result we have altered the timings we shift the cows to new pasture, to maximise rumination & rumen function.  Over time the cards have become a very familiar & useful tool."</p>

          <h2>Obsalim</h2>
            <p>Whilst farmers have a great deal of experience and knowledge, the missing link is in knowing exactly what’s going on in the herd at every moment:
            <br>How well are the animals responding to that ration? How efficiently are they grazing today? Why is there a gap between what their ration sheet predicts and what they are actually producing?</p>
            <p>The Obsalim observation method allows you to read your animals and know the answer to these questions in real time.</p>
            <div id="obsalim-text" class="collapse obsalim-text">
              <p>Learning the Obsalim observation method allows you to take all the knowledge and experience you currently have and take it to a whole new level</p>
              <p>Obsalim is a factual way of using a number of observable signs, on and around the animals, in order to assess exactly what is happening in the rumen. These signs are directly related to the status of the rumen and an indicator of its efficiency. Each sign has been uniquely determined and verified in practice for over two decades to have a specific relevance in relation to rumen function. By checking for the presence of these signs it is therefore possible to obtain real time information from the animals as to how they are responding to the ration.</p>
              <p>Hence the Obsalim Observation will provide information about how the rumen is responding to</p>
              <p>The energy, protein and fibre in the ration
              Access of the animals to the ration
              Quality, content and distribution of the ration</p>

               <h3>Acting on the Observation</h3>
               <p>Having undertaken an Obsalim Observation the farmer now knows how the rumen is performing and whether there is room for improvement. The process is very much like listening to the animals telling you how they are digesting the ration. The observation will not only tell you if there is room for improvement but in precisely which areas these can be made.  Action can then be directed towards this goal and verified within days by re-observation in the animals.</p>
               <p>For example, an observation might indicate that the animals are wasting energy and that the root cause is a shortage of structural fibre in the ration. The absence of which is responsible for feed transitioning too rapidly through the rumen and therefore inefficient transformation of fodder into production. By applying the Obsalim Observation method the farmer can discover this deficiency and take action to address the matter. The resolution being a greater productivity and saving for the farm.</p>
               <p>In another example the Obsalim observation may indicate that the animals are overeating and wasting a proportion of the ration due to an abnormal eating pattern. By discovering this fact the farmer can take appropriate action to reduce his losses. Without conducting the Obsalim observation the abnormal eating pattern would be unlikely to have been noticed.</p>
               <p>Obsalim uncovers the subtle issues that are generating problems leading to economical loss. It highlights where the causes lay and provides the opportunity to stem the wastage and turn losses into profits</p>
               <p>In conclusion, Obsalim informs you about the animal’s digestion and also gives you pointers as to how you can improve matters.</p>

               <h3>Confidence in decision making</h3>
               <p>Because it is known how long it takes for the various Obsalim signs to both appear and disappear, at any moment you will know how the animals respond to any changes you make. This provides the confidence to be able to make decisions about the ration without risk-taking.</p>
               <p>You’re already looking at your animals to see how they are doing. Obsalim will make your observations more refined and relevant. In time you will discover that your animals will prove to be the best guide to run your farm efficiently.</p>

               <h3>Wise Time investment</h3>
               <p>Disturbed rumen function leads not just to poor productivity but can also lead to poor health. Once the Obsalim observation method has been acquired it takes very little time to monitor the efficiency of rumination in your herd. This will free up time later on as you will be able to maintain productivity with less food wastage and less time spent dealing with a variety of health issues including lameness.</p>
               <p>Less food is wasted because applying the Obsalim method improves the effectiveness of the rumen. Less food means less time spent harvesting, transporting and storing.</p>
               <p>Using Obsalim can improve the efficiency of communication between farmer, staff and professionals providing advice on the farm.</p>

            <h2>Ruminant Health’s Obsalim courses</h2>

            <p>We organise two different courses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A course to learn how to use Obsalim on your farm</li>
              <li>An advanced course designed for future teachers and professionals who wish to study all aspects of Obsalim in order to teach this to clients and/or be licenced to use Obsalim ® in a farm advisory capacity</li>
            </ul>  

            <h2>Obsalim course</h2>
            <p>The course is delivered over three individual days spaced 2 -3 weeks apart and comprises:</p>

            <div id="courses-text" class="collapse courses-text">
              <ul>
                <li>An introductory session designed to teach the method, followed by a practical demonstration of Obsalim application on the farm </li>
                <li>A practical day spent on 3 local farms comparing and contrasting observations, discussing these in depth and reaching conclusions</li>
                <li>A fine-tuning day to hone and improve your skills, designed to extend your knowledge and provide a deeper insight into Obsalim. Further practical experience on the farm is included to consolidate this learning</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to the course above, three further training sessions on farm are arranged, by agreement with the students, to be delivered over a period of one to three months after the initial course.</p> 
              <p>In order to reduce course costs and produce a more meaningful experience we prefer to travel to you rather than ask you to expend time and expense in travelling to some centralized distant location. In this manner your travelling and accommodation expenses are greatly reduced as are the need to employ relief staff (if at all) for more than a few hours on study days. Time away from your farm is minimized whilst the benefit of learning in a local Obsalim support group is maximized.</p>
              <p>For practical purposes we require a minimum of 6 farmers (and a maximum of 10) in order to organize a course in your area. In order to learn quickly and effectively it is essential to create a local support group from the course members and to organize and facilitate local meetings following on from the Basic Course. To this end, at least one of the attendants should express a desire to act as a convener to facilitate local meetings amongst the participants. This ongoing local support is essential for all students to gain confidence in using Obsalim.</p>
              <p>The cost for the six days course above is £600 per participant. The course fee includes the essential practice tools you require to benefit from using Obsalim immediately.</p>
              <p>This fee is based on courses organized in the South of England and South Wales and the Midlands. For those further away there may be additional travel expenses.</p> 
              <p>In practice we know that each farmer who studies with us will learn to use Obsalim to serve their individual goals and vision for their farm.</p>
